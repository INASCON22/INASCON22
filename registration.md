# Registration has started – sign up now!

### Who can register?

Are you a PhD, Master or Bachelor student in biology, chemistry, physics or a related discipline?
Would you like to gain conference experience at an early stage of your career?
Are you interested in the facettes of nanoscience, interested in visualization techniques and seek interdisciplinary exchange? 


#### We are honored to organize INASCON 2023 for YOU! Save the date: August 22nd to 25th, 2023. Registration is open now! 

We are pleased to announce that **we are able to provide accomodation (bed & breakfast) for attendees from far away** to make up for a part of your travel expenses! Since there is a limited number of reservations we can make, you may want to sign up quickly – first come, first served! **Meals like lunch, dinner and coffee breaks will be provided by us for all participants!** The registration fee amounts to CHF 123.- .

Generally, attendance for INASCON 2023 is limited: We have space for up to 100 students from all around the world. Don't wait too long, we only have few open spots!

#### Deadlines:
- with hotel: ~~April 9th~~ – EXTENDED until April 28th!
- general attendance without hotel: ~~May 1st~~ June 1st
- abstract submission for talks and posters: June 1st

#### INASCON 2023 is *the* perfect opportunity to present your research and interests!

We highly encourage you to apply for a talk or to present a poster. INASCON 2023 is a great chance to practice how to present your research in an international, scientific and safe space among fellow students. On top of that, there will be a prize for the best poster and best talk – a camera set by Nikon!

*You have never made or presented a poster before? 
You don’t know what to put on your poster since you haven't started your Master's thesis/PhD yet?*

Don't worry. A poster is a starting point for a scientific discussion on a topic of your choice. We are looking forward to your presentation of your Bachelor's or Master's thesis, or even a research internship – anything that you deem interesting and relevant to the conference's topic: Make Nano Visible!

Here are some ideas for your poster:

- Your research motivation
- Your experimental results/ preliminary(!) data
- Your proposed research plan for your thesis
- Your experimental setup
- Ideas and questions on which you would like to get input from your fellow scientists
 

<!-- If you don't have any research experience because you are still in your Bachelor studies, you can still apply! Just make sure to let us know in the registration form with the following text:

*Unfortunately, I cannot present a poster because I am an undergraduate student.*<br>
*Number of your semesters you have studied so far* <br>
*Short(!) description of why you want to go to INASCON* -->

Are you ready?
